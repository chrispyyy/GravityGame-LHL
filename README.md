# GravityGame-LHL

This is a Lighthouse Labs Final Project
Created by Team Awesome


It is a single page application using Babylon.js for the 3-D rendering and Javascript for the back-end.

The objective of the game is to steer the spaceship to the target planet. But there are obstacles (asteroids) in the way! The user can click on the map to create a black hole. The black hole's gravitational pull will change the trajectory and velocity of the spaceship. But if the ship steers too close to the black hole it will get sucked in!
Play through all of the levels to beat the game!
